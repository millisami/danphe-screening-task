# README

This repository contains the code for the screeing task for the Rails software engineer role at Danphe Software Labs.

Every file can be run in the terminal as `ruby ./problem_{no}.rb` except the 6th problem file as it contains the active record model relations only without the proper rails app.

RSpec files are in the `spec/` folder.
To run the specs, pull the repo run `bundle` and run `bundle exec rspec`
